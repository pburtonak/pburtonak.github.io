Data Science - What does that even mean? I’ve already had the same conversation a half dozen times with friends over coffee. The conversations go the same way; I mention that I am starting a Data Science Bootcamp, and I get a quizzical look and some form of that question. 
I hardly feel qualified to answer that question. I’m still just dipping my toe into the waters of data science. But I can tell them what drew me to Data Science at least. Back when I was in college, finding the right major was a lengthy process. I started out in the engineering college, then thought about pre-med, then business. I think I must have changed my major at least a half-dozen times. I eventually found my place though, in Economics. 
I remember being on a layover and picking up book at an airport bookstore called “Freakonomics” when I was in school, and it captivated me. If you haven’t read it yet, it is a book by two Economists that explores how interconnected the world we live in is and uses statistical tools to really delve deep into the links between bizarre or seemingly unrelated cultural phenomena: everything from serious topics such as crime rates to the likelihood that Sumo wrestlers are throwing matches. This book piqued my interest, and I was lucky enough to have a fantastic professor in one of my first Econ classes, and I never looked back. 
Analyzing the world through the lens of statistics, prying deeper to see how variables are connected, and then observing what incentives can change behavior and how is the heart of econometrics. Years later, when I first read about the field of data science, it clicked. This was the same stuff. Granted, there are a lot of major difference between my classes back in university, and what I have been learning so far through the Data Science Bootcamp here at Flatiron, but data science and econometrics share many of the same core principles.  
I’m excited to see what projects and opportunities data science brings. In this modern era, we collect data on nearly everything. What type of music you are most likely to listen to on a Tuesday afternoon, the chance that your favorite NBA team’s bench-warmer will be able to step up and sink a key jumper late in the game, or which posts on social media you are most likely to engage with. These are all things that are already being heavily analyzed and predicted. To me, this is what draws me to data science; the idea that you can analyze and tinker with data to better understand and predict the world around us.
